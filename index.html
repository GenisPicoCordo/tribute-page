          "Terry Fox during his marathon of hope. He embarked on an east to west cross-Canada run to raise money and awareness for cancer research. Although the spread of his cancer eventually forced him to end his quest after 143 days and 5,373 kilometres (3,339 mi), and ultimately cost him his life, his efforts resulted in a lasting, worldwide legacy. The annual Terry Fox Run, first held in 1981, has grown to involve millions of participants in over 60 countries and is now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research; over C$800 million has been raised in his name as of April 2020"

       <h3 id="headline"><u>Here's a time line of Terry Fox life:</u></h3>
       <ul>

         <li><strong>June 01, 1976</strong>
           "In Grade 12, Fox and his friend Doug Alward are co-winners of the Athlete of the Year Award at their high school in Port Coquitlam. Terry is also an excellent student, graduating with one B on an otherwise straight-A report card"</li>
         <li><strong>November 12, 1976</strong>
           "Fox rear-ends a truck while driving on the highway. His car is a wreck, but Fox escapes without visible injury. The only problem is a sore right knee, which he assumes he hurt during the crash"</li>
         <li><strong>March 04, 1977</strong>
           "In December 1976, during his first year playing basketball at Simon Fraser University, Fox notices a new pain in his right knee. He thinks it is just a cartilage problem, but in early March he wakes up one morning to find he can’t stand. On 4 March 1977, he learns it is a tumour. He is diagnosed with osteogenic sarcoma, which often starts in the knee and spreads through the muscles and tendons"</li>
         <li><strong>March 09, 1977</strong>
           "When Fox is only 18, doctors amputate his right leg 15 cm above the knee. The night before his surgery, Fox’s high school coach, Terri Fleming, gives him a Runner’s World article about Dick Traum, an amputee who had run the New York City Marathon. The following morning, Fox shows the article to nurse Judith Ray. “Someday I’m going to do something like that,” he tells her. He soon begins physiotherapy and a 16-month chemotherapy program at the British Columbia Cancer Control Agency in Vancouver"</li>
         <li><strong>September 01, 1979</strong>
           "Fox competes in a race in Prince George, British Columbia. Although he had originally planned to run in the eight-and-a-half-mile race, he instead runs the 17-mile (27 km) version with friend Doug Alward and brother Darrell. Terry finished last, but only 10 minutes behind the final two-legged runner. Shortly after the race, Fox tells his parents of his plan to run across Canada. His mother, Betty, thinks it is crazy. His father, Rolly, simply asks when he plans to start"</li>

           "Fox begins his cross-country Marathon of Hope, dipping his artificial leg in the Atlantic Ocean and setting out from St. John’s, Newfoundland. He takes a bottle of water from the ocean, which he plans to empty into the Pacific when he dips his leg there at the end of his run"</li>
         <li><strong>August 27, 1980</strong>
           "5.153km running across the country. Terry writes in his journal about a 10-year-old boy who had lost his leg to cancer: “Greg rode his bike behind me for about six miles and it has to be the most inspirational moment I have had!… At night we had a beautiful reception in Terrace Bay. I spoke about Greg and couldn’t hold back the emotion.”</li>
         <li><strong>September 01, 1980</strong>
           "After running 5,373 km in 143 days, and having raised around $2 million, Fox stops his run in Thunder Bay due to chest pains. X-rays later reveal the cancer has spread to his lungs. Before returning to Port Coquitlam, he tells a press conference: “I'm gonna do my very best. I'll fight. I promise I won't give up.”"</li>
         <li><strong>September 19, 1980</strong>

        "The Marathon of Hope has now raised a total of $24.17 million. Terry achieves his goal to raise one dollar for every person in Canada (population 24.1 million)"</li>
      <li><strong>June 28, 1981</strong>
        "Terry Fox dies. After undergoing months of treatment for cancer, Terry contracts pneumonia in June 1981 and goes into a coma on 27 June. He dies at Royal Columbian Hospital in New Westminster at 4:35 a.m., one month before his 23rd birthday. The federal government orders flags across the country to be flown at half-mast. Addressing the House of Commons, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau says, “It occurs very rarely in the life of a nation that the courageous spirit of one person unites all people in the celebration of his life and in the mourning of his death.” Trudeau expresses, on behalf of all Canadians, “our profound gratitude for the gift which Terry gave to all of us, the gift of his own boundless courage and hope.”</li>
      <li><strong>September 01, 1992</strong>
